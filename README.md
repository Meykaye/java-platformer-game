# Java Platformer Game

This is a repository to track my personal progress in developing a 2D platformer game using Java.

## Overview

I aim to build a classic 2D platformer game using Java. The game will involve a player character navigating through various levels, jumping between platforms and avoiding enemies. I intend to do this project as a hobby as I like to take interest in gaming.

## Development Stages as of now

### 1. Project Setup and Basic Player Movement (17/8/2023)

- Created a new Java project with the help of Eclipse IDE
- Set up the project structure and added necessary resource directories.

### 2. Player Animation (21/8/2023)

- Added animation in a sprite of size 256x288
- Implemented only 3 functional animations
- Plan on expanding animations for the player in the future

### 3. Collision and Gravity System (25/8/2023)

- Added collision to the Player model
- Added Gravity along with animations that go along with Gravity

### 4. Background and Images (30/8/2023)

- Developing pause menu screen

### 5. Pause Menu and Buttons (31/8/2023)

### 6. Enemies, Hitbox and Combat system (10/9/2023)

## Future plans

I still plan on processing new ideas to add in my current game and focus on continuous development for the game
