# Personal Java Platformer Game Progress

This is a repository to track my personal progress in developing a 2D platformer game using Java.

## Overview

I aim to build a classic 2D platformer game using Java. The game will involve a player character navigating through various levels, jumping between platforms, avoiding enemies. I intend to do this project as a hobby as I like to talk and design related to gaming.

## Development Stages as of now

### 1. Project Setup and Basic Player Movement (17/8/2023)

- Created a new Java project with the help of Eclipse IDE
- Set up the project structure and added necessary resource directories.
- Implemented the basic player character and enabled left/right movement along with mouse movement.

### 2. Player Animation (21/8/2023)

- Added animation in a sprite of size 256x288
- Implemented only 3 functional animations
- Plan on expanding animations for the player in the future

### 3. Level Creation (24/8/2023)

- Testing levels with different collision systems as of now
- Using Red values from RGB for level creation (prototype)

### 4. Collision System (25/8/2023)

- Added collision to the Player model

## Future plans

I still plan on processing new ideas to add in my current game and focus on continuous development for the game
